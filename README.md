# Login Page
This repo shows a working Login and Registration page that communicates with a MySQL database

# Requirements
- XAMPP, or similar, or a website host
- An active database

# How to set up
1. Download the files
2. Put them onto your web server
I used XAMPP to test the functionality. To do the same, go to your XAMPP install directory and open the htdocs folder. Put the included folders and files in to that folder.
